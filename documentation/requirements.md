## Requirements specification

### Purpose

In tabletop roleplaying games, it is common for the game master to use a “battlemap” or a grid to visualize the combat of game. The grid is made from squares that symbolize 5ft. X 5ft. area. With this software, user can generate a grid of any size they want and bring tokens symbolizing both players and monsters to the grid. 

### Basic functionality

- [x] user generate grid of their chosen size
- [x] user can bring tokens to the grid
	- [x] token size can vary from one square to 3x3 squares
- [ ] user can move tokens on the grid
	- [ ] with mouse 
	- [ ] and/or arrow buttons

### Development ideas

Ideas to expand functionality of software.

- user can choose grids background: 
	- [x] color
	- [x] color of the grid
	- [ ] and opacity of the grid
- a measurement tool to measure distance, e.g. between tokens
- different spell areas, e.g. 20ft. radius sphere, 20ft. cube etc.
